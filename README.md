Infernal Engine
===============

Infernal Engine is a web-app which allows the user to understand what's happening at the scene of a rural fire. You can view the demo at [chadoliver.github.io/infernal-engine/index.html](http://chadoliver.github.io/infernal-engine/index).

To run this demo from your own computer (not the website), unzip the folder then open index.html.
